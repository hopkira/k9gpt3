# Chatbot with K9's personality using GPT-3

This very simple program (k9gpt.py) provides a text based chatbot facility for a robot dog that is trained to interact like K9. Follow the instructions in this [blog post](https://k9-build.blogspot.com/2022/07/affirmative-master-chatbots-with.html) for the instructions to install the pre-requisite module and get an OpenAI API key.  Simply execute "python k9gpt.py" and start interacting.  WARNING - OpenAI's models are not free to use, so if you decide to use a pay account, it would be wise to add Usage Limits, as each interaction generated by this program will use around 640 tokens.
